## Next

- Add "not before" functionality
- Consolidate and improve due-date specification (e.g., "next year")
- Add 'events today' function (and similar) using tag:event
- Add 'errands today' function (and similar) using tag:errand
- Add support for event completion history (last week, last month, etc.)
- Export to markdown
- add start/end times to activities tagged "event"? and add functions around that?
- add "not" filter for listuings, e.g., "due this week not today" or "due this week not:today" or "due this week not(due:today") -- I like the last of these syntaxes
- auto-prune history on daily and weekly activities leaving only most recent cycle of completion (keep history and JSON from getting too huge)
